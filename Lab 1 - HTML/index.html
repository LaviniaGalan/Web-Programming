                    Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan, DBE (nee Miller; 15 September 1890 – 12 January 1976) was an English 
                    writer known for her sixty-six detective novels and fourteen short story collections, particularly those revolving around 
                    fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. She also wrote the world's longest-running play, The Mousetrap, which 
                    was performed in the West End from 1952 to 2020, as well as six novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. In 1971, she was 
                    made a Dame (DBE) for her contributions to literature. Guinness World Records lists Christie as the best-selling fiction 
                    writer of all time, her novels having sold more than two billion copies.

                    <section>
                        Christie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon, and was largely home-schooled. 
                        She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when The Mysterious Affair
                        at Styles, featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was published. Her first husband was Archibald Christie; they married in 1914
                        and had one child before divorcing in 1928. During both World Wars, she served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough
                        knowledge of the poisons which featured in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. Following her marriage to archaeologist
                        Max Mallowan in 1930, she spent several months each year on digs in the Middle East and used her first-hand knowledge of his
                        profession in her fiction.

                    According to Index Translationum, she remains the most-translated individual author. 
                    Her novel And Then There Were None is one of the highest-selling books of all time, with approximately 100 million 
                    copies sold. Christie's stage play The Mousetrap holds the world record for the longest initial run. It opened at the 
                    Ambassadors Theatre in the West End of London on 25 November 1952, and by September 2018 there had been more than 
                    27,500 performances. The play was closed down in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
